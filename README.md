__This repository should be deployed into and synchronized with Digital Grinnell's repositoryX:/usr/local/fedora/solr/collection1/conf directory.__

This is a collection of key configuration files from Digital Grinnell's FEDORA repository (currently RepositoryX) server and the /usr/local/fedora/solr/collection1/conf directory found there.
Solr and FedoraGSearch were initially upgraded to this configruation on RepositoryX in late-June and early-July 2017 following the process documented at https://github.com/discoverygarden/basic-solr-config/wiki/Guide-to-Setting-up-GSearch-2.7-with-Solr-4.2.0.  The upgrade however was to Solr version 4.2.1.
